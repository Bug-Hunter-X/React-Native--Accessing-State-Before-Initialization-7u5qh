# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This typically happens when rendering a component before an asynchronous operation (e.g., a network request) that updates the state has completed.  The code shows the problematic situation and provides a solution using conditional rendering to prevent crashes.

## Problem
The example code renders a component that tries to access `this.state.data.someProperty` before `this.state.data` has been populated by an asynchronous `fetch` request. This will cause a runtime error if the component attempts to render before the `fetch` call has finished and updated the state.

## Solution
The solution is to handle the case where `this.state.data` might still be null. This is done by conditionally rendering the component's content based on the state.  If `this.state.data` is null, an alternative view (e.g., a loading indicator) can be displayed. Once `this.state.data` has been properly set, the main content of the component will render correctly.
